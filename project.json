  "challenges": "While working on this project, I encountered a challenge in selecting user roles, as this task was entirely new to me. However, I successfully managed to implement it. Later, I faced another challenge when determining how to display data in the UI based on the user's role. To address this, I created a custom hook responsible for managing user roles. This hook ensures that data is displayed appropriately in the UI according to the user's role. As a result, users can view their respective data on their designated dashboards based on their roles."
